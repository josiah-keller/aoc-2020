# Advent of Code 2020 solutions

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges. Each subdirectory corresponds to one daily challenge. Each challenge has two parts. Sometimes I have separate code solutions for the two parts, other times a single program serves as both solutions. Some of my solutions are quick and dirty (or lazy) while others are over-engineered. Some of them may be written in languages that I do not know well. Each solution should output descriptive help information if run with `-h`. I may add additional README files for individual solutions if it's warranted. Note that ultimately, my only metric for whether the program "works" is if it provides the correct answer for the purposes of the AoC challenge.
